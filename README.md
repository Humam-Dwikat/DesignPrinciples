# DesignPrinciples

Trying to apply the Design Principles

it is a stupid code and It will be subject to modification step by step

in this assignment, there a three users, and all users a Staff
so I did a base class it is Staff and the other users inherit from the user 
there is a small difference between them but overall they are staff.

and On the other hand, I have made a fake database to store the users on it
